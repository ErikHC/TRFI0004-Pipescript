# TRFI0004-Pipescript-Summer2023
Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) pipescripts for reducing Alamo TRFI0004 datasets during summer 2023 research at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). We looked at five datasets spanning an entire Very Large Array (VLA) antenna configuration cycle (A->D->C->B->A) between March 2022 and July 2023. We are analyzing the impact that Starlink satellite communication has on VLA astronomical imaging after the installation of 59 user terminals (UTs) on the Alamo Navajo Reservation in June 2022.
